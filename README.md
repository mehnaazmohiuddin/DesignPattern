# This git repository demonstrate some of the important  Design Pattern used in the industry
1. Abstract Factory Pattern
    - has an Abstract Factory, has Abstract Products too and then , the client that uses the factory, can easily switch from one factory to another.
    - We need this factory so that client only know about the things that are to be used together, something like utility, when u have many reated things but come in different flavour. use this pattern.
2. Factory Method Pattern
      - we can have a default implementation in the factory method. Which acts like a hook. 
      - the subclasses have the power to choose which object to create.
3. Adapter Pattern
   - Used to connect 2 interfaces that have difference in their method signatures. But have more or less the same working. 
   - There is something called 2 way adapter , where there is an existing class that we have extended or we have implemented 2 interfaces together., and we also implement the adaptee.
