# This git repository demonstrate some of the important  Design Pattern used in the industry
1. Abstract Factory Pattern
    - have an Abstract Factory, have Abstract Products too and then , the client that uses the factory, can easily switch from one factory to another.
    - We need this factory so that client only know about the things that are to be used together, something like utility, when u have many reated things but come in different flavour. use this pattern.
2. Factory Method Pattern
